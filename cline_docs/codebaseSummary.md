# Codebase Summary

## Key Components and Their Interactions

### Server Component (src/server.py)
- Main MCP server implementation
- Handles client connections and requests
- Manages AWS service interactions

### Athena Client (src/athena_client.py)
- Handles AWS Athena operations
- Manages query execution and results
- Interfaces with AWS Cost and Usage Reports

### Utilities (src/utils.py)
- Common utility functions
- Helper methods for AWS operations
- Shared functionality across components

## Data Flow
1. Client requests received through MCP protocol
2. Server processes requests using appropriate AWS service clients
3. Data retrieved from AWS services
4. Results formatted and returned to clients

## External Dependencies
### Primary Dependencies (requirements.txt)
- AWS SDK (boto3)
- MCP SDK
- Other Python packages for server functionality

### Configuration Management
- Environment variables (.env)
- Template provided (.env.example)
- AWS credentials and configuration

## Recent Significant Changes
- Initial project setup completed
- Basic MCP server structure implemented
- Environment configuration template created
- Documentation structure reorganized from memory-bank to cline_docs

## User Feedback Integration
- No user feedback received yet
- Structure in place for incorporating future feedback
- Documentation will be updated based on user requirements
