# Technology Stack

## Core Technologies
- Python: Primary programming language
- Model Context Protocol (MCP): For server-client communication
- AWS SDK (Boto3): For AWS service interactions

## AWS Services
- CloudFormation: Stack management and monitoring
- CloudWatch: Metrics and monitoring
- Cost Explorer: Billing and cost analysis
- Athena: Query execution for cost analysis
- DynamoDB: NoSQL database monitoring
- ECS: Container service monitoring
- SQS: Queue service monitoring

## Development Tools
- Virtual Environment: Python venv for dependency isolation
- Environment Variables: For configuration management
  - Using .env for local development
  - .env.example as template for required configurations

## Architecture Decisions
### MCP Server Design
- Client-Server Architecture
  - Server interacts with AWS services
  - Clients connect via MCP protocol
- Singleton Pattern for AWS SDK clients
- Factory Pattern for tool creation

### Security
- AWS IAM for authentication
- Environment variables for sensitive configuration
- No credentials in version control

### Performance Considerations
- Efficient data retrieval patterns
- Optimized query execution
- Connection pooling for AWS services
